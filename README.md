# fuzzy-model-reference-adaptive-control-for-manipulator
[1] investigates a fuzzy model reference adap tive controller (FMRAC) for continuous-time multiple-input–mul tiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems. The proposed adaptive scheme uses a Takagi–Seguno (TS) fuzzy adaptive system, which allows for the inclusion of a priori information in terms of qual itative knowledge about the plant operating points or analytical regulators (e.g., state feedback) for those operating points. A pro portional-integral update law is used to obtain a fast parameters adaptation. The simulation results, for a two-link robot, confirm the performance of the proposed ap proach.
